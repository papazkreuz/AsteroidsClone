<h3> How to Play </h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player controlls a space ship that can rotate clockwise, anti-clockwise, and can fire shots forwards from its 'nose'. The ship can also thrust forwards, coupled with inertia acceleration and deceleration. You can only move the ship in the direction it is pointing.</li>
    <li>The player can also use Hyperspace jumps, causing the ship to vanish before reappearing in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing by appearing on top of an asteroid). </li>
    <li>Each level begin with a few asteroids drifting and floating in random directions across the screen. All in-game objects wraps around the screen edges, for example an asteroid that drifts off the top area of the screen would re-appear at the bottom of the screen and continue drifting in the same direction. </li>
    <li>As the player shoot asteroids, they shatter into smaller pieces that usually move faster. </li>
    <li>Periodically, a UFO appears on one side of the screen and move across to the other side before disappearing. These enemies are of two kinds: Large saucers fire in random directions, while the small saucers are aiming at the player's ship </li>
    <li>Once the screen is cleared of all asteroids (and UFO if any are on screen), a new set of large asteroids appears, denser in number than the last. </li>
    <li>Every 10'000 points achieved by player gives him 1 life, but only 10 lives can be stored. </li>
    <li>Game is endless and only ends when the player lose all of his or her lives. </li>
  </ul>
